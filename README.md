This project aimed to determine the factors influencing NBA game attendance, particularly examining whether higher-scoring games attract more fans. We analyzed data from recent NBA seasons (2017-2019), focusing on variables such as average points per game (PPG), team win percentage, city population size, and average ticket price. The goal was to understand fan preferences and provide insights for improving game attendance.

Our analysis included regression models to identify significant predictors of attendance, controlling for various factors including team performance in the previous season, weekend versus weekday games, and economic variables.

Key findings include:

Both our regression models showed positive coefficients for team win percentage, indicating that winning teams draw more fans. This aligns with the intuitive idea that fans prefer to watch successful teams.
A significant discrepancy was observed in the PPG coefficients between our study and Todd Copenhaverâ€™s earlier study. While Copenhaver found a positive PPG coefficient (187.25), suggesting fans preferred higher-scoring games during the 2007-2008 season, our analysis showed a negative PPG coefficient (-31.4972).
This unexpected negative coefficient suggests that in recent seasons, fans may prefer attending games with lower scores, potentially due to closer, more competitive matchups or a greater appreciation for defensive play. This shift in fan preference could reflect a broader trend away from high-scoring blowouts toward more balanced, strategic games.
